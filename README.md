Active in the IT industry since 1998, involving several disciplines ranging from integrator and architect of enterprise-class IT services to becoming a web technologies expert from 2004. Leading the design and technical architecture of public web sites and intranets related projects and web applications and developing project management tasks very often, focusing in agile and lean methodologies. Expert on state-of-the-art web technologies, content management solutions, electronic gadgets and IT world in general.

I've spent the early years of my professional career being linked to the university environment where I was working for more than 15 years. I'm very familiar with a university needs, its insides and outs and the day to day operations in academic environments. Lately focused delivering enterprise level solutions for German private sector research institutions and government as well, leading the kitconcept GmbH team, as technology director and lead developer.

Involved with the Open Source community since 2005, especially with the Python-based Plone CMS (http://plone.org) community, contributing with code, organizing sprints and attending Plone Conferences as speaker. Organizer of the Barcelona Plone Conference 2017 (https://2017.ploneconf.org) held at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya.

On 2010 I authored a book called "Plone 3 Intranets", published by Packt Publishing. It was targeted to beginners and users with no previous experience about Plone who wants to learn to design, build and deploy a reliable, full-featured, and secure Plone-based intranet easily from scratch.

Considering myself as a person that "makes things happen", a passionate of technology, and lover of creating useful things.

My personal goal is to be part of great projects helping to create things used by thousands of persons.
